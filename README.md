# Recipe Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we studied the effectiveness of spice challenges in building team morale.
The data that I have access to is a subset of the raw data used in the original report, containing only the recipes and reviews posted since 2008, since the original data is quite large.

RAW_recipes.csv contains the recipes, while RAW_interactions.csv contains the reviews.

I was investigating the correlation between the cooking time and average rating of recipes. People 

##### Number of rows: 83782

##### Relevant Columns: 
minutes: number of minutes it takes to prepare each recipe
calories (#): number of calories for each recipe 
sodium: the amount of sodium used for each recipe 
rating: average rating for each recipe

## Cleaning and EDA

### Cleaning Data
Here are the steps I took to clean the data:
1. Left merge the recipes and rating datasets together so that the cooking times and the ratings are in the same dataset
2. Replace all ratings of 0 with np.nan in the merged dataset, as rating of 0 means the user did not rate.
3. Find the average rating per recipe as a Series and add this Seriesback to the merged recipes dataset
4. Convert the tags column from strings to lists
5. Convert nutrition column from strings to lists, then separate a list of nutritional labels to several different columns. This helps to detect if the missingness of a column has to do with nutritional columns.
6. Remove nutrition column as nutritional labels (calories, total sugar, etc.) are separated into different columns
7. Move rating to the last column
8. Convert nutritional labels from strings to floats (Quantify the labels)

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/cooking-time-uni.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>


As you can see, most of the recipes take no more than 150 minutes to prepare. For the recipes that take no more than 150 minutes to prepare, most of the them take about 20 to 50 minutes to prepare. However, as shown on the graph, some can take as long as 10000000 to 100000000 minutes to prepare.

### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/calories-min-scatter.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

As you can see, the bottom-left corner of the graph takes is the most dense part of the scatterplot. Notice that there are some data points at the top-left corner of the plot, meaning that the recipe does not have a lot of calories even though it takes a long time to prepare that recipe. On the other hand, there are some data points at the bottom-right corner of the plot, meaning that the recipe has a lot of calories even though it does not take a long time to prepare that recipe.

Note: Recipes that take more than 500000 minutes to prepare or has more than 500000 calories are not on the scatterplot
